# CharacterSheet

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.

This is an Angular App, connected via Express and Mongoose to a MongoDB backend.

This is an intermediary branch, trying to bring a past MEAN stack to the Angular Web App I've bean building for MSSE 696

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Please run `npm run dev` first in the `/backend` directory for the MongoDB to be available.
